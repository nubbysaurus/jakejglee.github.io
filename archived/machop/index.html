  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>
  It is hard to make anything without access to a nice workspace. As my housemate 
  and I reclaimed our cluttered garage for the valuable space, we disassembled large 
  wooden structures that left us with a ton of scrap wood. I called dibs and thus 
  this journey into woodworking began.
  </p>
  <h2>break it down</h2>
  <h3>mk.i</h3>
  <p>
  Rewind about a year: I put together my first attempt at a workbench right after 
  I moved in. This rough draft was hastily assembled, crude, and could best be 
  described as abstract art. It was too wobbly, narrow, cluttered, and uneven to 
  be very useful, so I was happy to tear it down when we cleaned out the garage. 
  </p>
  <h3>mk.ii</h3>
  <p>
  My next attempt at a workbench that could even be described as woodworking 
  started. I found a 
  <a href="https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/ultimate-roll-away-workbench-miter-saw-stand">design online</a> 
  by Ana White that I liked, made a couple modifications to meet my space and 
  functional needs, and started cutting parts with my housemate's miter saw. The 
  design for this version was a big improvement from my previous mess, but it didn't 
  explain woodworking in absolute beginner-friendly language (like how to form perfect 
  90<span>&#176;</span> joints in wood, for instance). After assembling its frame, I 
  was concerned that it was still too uneven and unsturdy and decided to start over. 
  On top of not knowing basic woodworking principles, I hadn't considered how oblong 
  my 2x4s were, in part because I hadn't stored them properly during the freak 
  lightning storms that happened here in the middle of summer.
  </p>
  <p>
  Unable to achieve right-angled joints, I tried to dismantle my first frame 
  and start over. However, since I stripped some screws trying to take it apart and
  had wood-glued its nearly-perpendicular joints together, it is now helping to cradle 
  my tomato plants in my garden, shown in Figure 1.

  <p>
  Researching online, I learned how to use my miter saw (it rotates?!) to make 
  45<span>&#176;</span> cuts and create stronger, more elegant joints for my 
  frames. During my research, I stumbled on a video of someone using cable ties 
  rather than big clamps to keep their table's frame together as the wood glue at 
  its joints dried. Since I don't (*yet) have clamps, I followed suit and came back 
  about a day later and was happy with my frames this time.
  </p>

  <h5 class="fig">Figure 2. Mitered frames look real nice for mkiii.</h5>
  <p>
  Next, I did some trial and error, as well as some freestyle wood balancing/leaning 
  methods, to attach the legs to my frames. Convinced that tables were level and equal 
  in height, I reinforced them and placed them in their staging area. Here, I attached 
  them to each other to form the miter saw's stand and rechecked that everything 
  was level. Unfortunately, the miter saw was too high up on its stand since I'd 
  mistakenly raised the frames of each table ~1/4" too high. My neighbor Shawn 
  suggested that I buy some 1/4" plywood for the saw's frame and reinforce 
  it with studs where the saw attaches. Thankful for the wisdom, I grabbed some from 
  the store and got to cutting.

  Here, I realized why my parents probably didn't want me to take woodshop. 
  Borrowing my dad's circular saw, I sketchily cut through 1/2" plywood mounted on 
  top of evenly spaced 2x4s laid on their sides. Somehow leaving that process with 
  all of my fingers, I was energized and ready to finish.
  </p>
  <p>
  I attached the plywood surfaces to its companion frames, completed the shelf 
  for my electronics section of the bench, hung a couple of power strips, 
  attached some lights, and called it a day...and then remembered to clean up.

  <p>
  Since completing my workspace, I've added a roll-out toolbox and a wet/dry vaccuum 
  under the miter saw to catch sawdust. Overall, this bench is working very well for 
  my needs.
  </p>
  <h2>future work</h2>
  <p>
  I would like to put in better wiring that would let me use more than 15A of 
  current and more electronic test equipment simultaneously. As it is now, I 
  cannot run both my vaccuum and the miter saw simultaneously.
