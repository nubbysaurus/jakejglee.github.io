  <h2>nubby on Jake</h2>
  <p>
  Jake Lee, or nubby, is an engineer, maker, artist, and aspiring farmer.
  Jake graduated from the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz 
  in 2017 with a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree and a minor in Computer 
  Engineering. As an undergraduate, Jake discovered his passion for 
  engineering design, and now keeps himself entertained by reading datasheets, 
  writing modular code, and trying not to cut off his limbs with power tools. 
  He aspires to earn his Professional Engineering certification so that 
  he can be involved in the design of sustainability-minded buildings for 
  low-income housing and "deep-green" infrastructure in the state of California.
  During the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, Jake has spent his time developing 
  cheap Ag-tech and volunteering at the 
  <a href="https://www.spadeandplow.com/">Spade and Plow</a> farm in San Martin.

  <h2>nubby on Sustainability</h2>
  <p>
  Sustainability is objectively not hard to put into practice, but our social 
  infrastructure props up outdated industries and counters meaningful change. 
  Short-term convenience is largely substituted for mindfulness, and it is 
  near-impossible to live in our culture without using plastic products, 
  eating food from industrial farms, and throwing out obscene amounts of trash. 
  We don't/can't think about this stuff. Taking responsibility for every small 
  thing that we use in our already-hectic lives would lead most Americans into 
  bankruptcy and/or insanity. Sustainability is often viewed as a privileged 
  issue, but the people who suffer most from our collective negligence are 
  disadvantaged communities around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
  All our trash winds up somewhere. All our wastes come back to us eventually. 
  Sustainability is karma and survival.
