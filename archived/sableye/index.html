  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>
  Building a "universal" device interface is impractical, but it would make collecting 
  data from devices a lot easier. Programs like LabView are pretty good at providing 
  a nice user interface for setting up communications, but even that is limited (not 
  to mention it is so expensive!).
  </p>
  <p>
  Project sableye came about after I left my last job and started playing with sensors 
  at home. Pretty quickly, it got frustrating hard-coding every sensor communication 
  protocol on my Raspberry Pi, and metadata generated for data collection sessions 
  was either outdated or irrelevant. I also found that trying to run OpenCV with my 
  webcams often caused my code to block. My goals for this project were thus:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>to make a standardized framework for device communications that facilitates 
      integrating new devices.</li>
    <li>to run the framework on either Debian or Raspbian.
    <li>to allow a user to verify device operation without blocking all other 
      devices.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>break it down</h2>
  <h3>opencv-camera device</h3>
  <p>
  First, what can you do with a USB-connected camera? Mainly, taking a picture and 
  recording a video come to mind, but you also need to be able to establish and break 
  communications with it. That leaves us with the following methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>take_picture()</code></li>
    <li><code>start_recording(duration=0.0)</code></li>
    <li><code>stop_recording()</code></li>
    <li><code>connect()</code></li>
    <li><code>disconnect()</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Taking 
  <a href="https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html">OpenCV's Python 3 API</a>, 
  video and image capture are based on the <code>VideoCapture</code> object. Each 
  opencv-camera object in sableye interacts with one of these objects within the 
  previously listed methods. <code>start_recording()</code> can be set by passing 
  it an optional <code>duration</code> float greater than 0.0; otherwise, it will 
  record until either a) a <code>stop_recording()</code> request is received, b) 
  connection with the device is terminated, or c) the sableye framework terminates.
  </p>
  <h3>i2c-adc device</h3>
  <p>
  Next, I wanted to build an interface for the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085">ADS1115</a> 
  I<sup>2</sup>C ADC while reusing as much code as possible from the opencv-camera 
  object. This new i2c-adc class shares the <code>connect()</code>, 
  <code>disconnect()</code>, <code>start_recording()</code>, and 
  <code>stop_recording()</code> methods and does not need any additional functionality. 
  However, the most straightforward way to communicate with this device type is by 
  using the Adafruit <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADS1X15">library</a>. 
  In the future, I might want to build a more standard I<sup>2</sup>C interface that 
  can be used with a wider set of devices, or multiple simultaneously. I am not sure if 
  the Adafruit library can accommodate those yet, but I want to point out that by this 
  stage of design, I was starting to feel like this was not a total waste of time.
  </p>
  <h3>integration</h3>
  <p>
  The shared methods between my two devices could be placed into a super-class, named 
  <code>Sensor</code>. I anticipated controlling a power relay for 
  <a href="">another project</a>, so I abstracted away the <code>connect</code> 
  and <code>disconnect</code> methods, plus other useful methods for metadata 
  generation, methods for querying device status, and helper methods into a 
  "super-super-class" called <code>Device</code> which is inherited by the 
  <code>Sensor</code> class.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now that two devices were added to my framework, I wanted them to both be able to 
  carry out their individual jobs while "playing nicely" with each other; i.e. not 
  block individual device communications. The control structure used by sableye 
  <code>Devices</code> is based on the 
  <a href="https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmpe118/Fall15/Labs/ES_Framework_2014.pdf">Events and Services framework</a>, 
  but with potentially blocking processes spawned and polled for status updates each 
  iteration of the main loop.
  </p>
  <h2>to-do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>add pH sensor</li>
    <li>add motor controls</li>
    <li>add relay controls</li>
    <li>integrate SPI</li>
    <li>build as ROS node/s</li>
    <li>improve efficiency</li>
  </ul>
