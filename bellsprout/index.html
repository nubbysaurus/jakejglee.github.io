  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>
  At the end of every January for the past three years, I have wanted to step up my 
  seed germination game. Since my time volunteering at
  <a href=https://www.spadeandplow.com/>Spade and Plow</a>, I've been wondering how
  to cheaply get the best yields from a scalable seed germination setup. Two years ago,
  I bought a cheap-o germination pad online (like
  <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/p/Viagrow-20-5-in-x-8-5-in-Seed-Propagating-Seedling-Heat-Mat-VSEEDMAT/202985174>
    this one
  </a> and got some seeds to germinate unevenly in my tray. I found it hard to keep the
  tray appropriately damp as well, and I managed to both dry the tray out when I forgot
  to water it and attracted cockroaches when I flooded it. Additionally, the cheap-o
  heat pad that I purchased did not have the ability to change heat output. More control
  over heat output would allow me to germinate seeds that require different
  temperatures/humidities to sprout, plus I could react to changes in ambient temperature.
  </p>
  <h2>design</h2>
  <p>
  Whilst digging through a/[my] pile of E-waste, I very conveniently came across a board
  that was previously used to power heat tape on a probably-long-gone test fixture (below).
  <img src="/imgs/bellsprout-ewaste_heat_brd.jpg">
  This board comes complete with ICs for monitoring temperature via four optional thermo-
  couples, which largely takes care of my temperature regulation needs. I even dug up a
  complementary Arduino Micro uC to test the entire board. I am currently recreating the
  board's schematic in KiCAD, and my analysis so far is that it was well thought-out.
  </p>
  <p>
  This board is powered by two power supplies: the heating circuitry runs at 5V max, while
  the digital bits are at 3.3V, which is generated by the Arduino through a USB-micro
  connector. I am a little concerned about connecting to the Arduino through my
  computer while running the heat board in case something shorts in a disasterous way, but
  so far I haven't found any red flags with how the board was designed. The power planes
  look well-enough insulated from each other, and if the Arduino can source enough current
  for the thermocouple sensors and their ICs, this is worth testing.

  coming soon...but NiCr and SPI are spoilers.
