  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>
  Connecting Li-ion battery cells (18650) in series is a good way to power 
  electronics for applications ranging from LEDs to electric vehicles. To build 
  a custom battery pack, you only need to connect however many battery cells 
  in series required to meet your application's voltage spec, connect cells in 
  parallel to meet your applicatoins's power budget/max current spec, get an 
  appropriate charger and regulator, and WHAM: you've got a battery pack that 
  can power anything you could possibly imagine.
  </p>
  <p>
  If it were that easy, this wouldn't be as much fun.
  </p>
  <p>
  The above fairy tale makes some big assumptions:
  <ol>
    <li>Each battery is identical.</li>
    <p>
    While battery makers will give you a good idea for a battery cell's typical 
    voltage range and capacity, no two cells are perfectly the same. This 
    necessitates smarter ways of judging a cell's state of charge (SOC) than 
    waiting for it to reach a certain voltage.
    </p>
    <li>Charge distributes evenly to each cell.</li>
    <p>
    Aside from each cell's uniqueness, factors like temperature, age, and SOC 
    change the mobility of charge carriers within a cell. Without taking these 
    into account, it is hard to gauge battery capacity. If you connect a charger 
    across a series set of cells alone, you will end up with some cells with 
    too much charge and others with too little charge, a recipe for battery 
    failure and even explosions.
