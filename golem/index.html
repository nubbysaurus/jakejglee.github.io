  The design used by nubby was _heavily_ influenced by the folks at <a href="http://www.domerama.com/calculators/3v-geodesic-dome-calculator/3v-flat-base-815-kruschke-calculator/">Domerama</a>.
  The majority of calculations were done using their handy calculator, and I would
  recommend checking their tools out as a starting point if you are interested in
  building your own dome(s).

  <h3>materials</h3>
  <p>
  This dome was made of only 1/2" electrical conduit (EMT), 2 1/2"-1/4" bolts, washers,
  and standard nuts. The main challenge in material selection was trying to optimize
  conduit usage since it only comes in 10' rods. After deciding on the dimensions of
  my design/each strut of conduit, I filled a sheet with every potential combination of
  strut lengths that would fit within the 10' strut length available for purchase. I
  found that a few options for cutting the struts would give me the same amount of waste...
  --------
  The EMT was best-priced at The Home Depot.
